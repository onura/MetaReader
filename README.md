MetaReader
==========


Purpose of the Meta Reader Project is not only supplying a free tool to extract meta data from well known file formats for users, but also providing an open source library to implement Meta Reader modules easily for less known or custom file formats. Additionally, real time file processing is an outstanding feature of Meta Reader.

We narrowed down to concept of metadata such that it defines information about documents which answers these three fundamental questions:

    Who has created this document?

    Which program has it been created by?

    When and where  was it created or last modified?


Users can use Meta Reader for four aim. First of all, it can be used for forensic investigations. Secondly, a user could verify the source of a document. Itâ€™s real time processing feature can be used for massive file processing of search engine results as well. Lastly, someone can use it as a library to easily create a metadata reader for any document format.
